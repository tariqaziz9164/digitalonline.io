This is the story of electronics. 
The main hub where hardware and software interact with each other. 
This is a playground of modern electronics systems. 
In this algorithm, I take inputs from sensors that measure voltage and current in time intervals then execute some formulas and generate outputs. This is the Maximum power tracking system of solar energy. This project is useful to clear concepts about sensors inputs and outputs. This coding is very helpful in many embedded systems.
